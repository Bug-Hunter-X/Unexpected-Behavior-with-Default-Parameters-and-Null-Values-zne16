This example demonstrates an uncommon issue in ActionScript related to default parameter values. When a function with a default parameter is called and null or undefined is explicitly provided for that parameter, the default value is still used instead of being skipped. This is different from other languages that would typically use the provided null value. The solution involves explicitly checking for null or undefined values and handling them appropriately.
